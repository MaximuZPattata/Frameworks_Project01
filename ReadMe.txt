# Developers :
	- This project was done by Max Sherwin

# About Project :
	- The project uses certain framework patterns to implement and recreate the game - ROBOTRON2084

	- The project has used a pattern called "Abstract Factory" in it's code. The files related to "Abstract Factory" pattern code are placed in the folder "Enemy Factory" in the solution.
	
	- Was able to implement player movement in 8 directions, player shooting in 8 directions, object destruction and enemy spawn - Grunt.
	
	- The json file "SceneDescription.json" holds the file path for the models and the model details of the game.

## How to build and run : 
	- The solution "Robotron2084.sln" has to be built(either in debug or release platform mode) and then once succeeded(probably will!), make the "Robotron2084" project as the startup project and now it'll be able to run for some visual treat. 
	
### Controls :
	- Player controls are as follows : 
		- Arrow keys[UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT] = Move camera Front, Back, Left and Right respectively. 
		- W,A,S,D = These buttons are to be pressed to shoot. A combination of 2 buttons will shoot diagonally (example W + A - will shoot in the top left diagonal)
	- No camera controls

#### Limitations to the project : 
	- Wasnt able to implement all of the patterns and methods. Will perfect it soon.
	- Wasnt able to recreate the whole game. Will perfect it soon.
